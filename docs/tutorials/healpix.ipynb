    "# Working with Healpix data\n",
    "\n",
    "Healpix has been used in cosmology for more than 20 years. See https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/html/intro.htm for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Healpix divides the sphere into sperical rectangles (\"pixels\") of equal size, starting with 12 \"base pixels\". Each of these \"base pixels\" is then further subdivided into 4 equally sized rectangles. The number of subdivisions is called \"order\", while the total number of rectangles within a \"base pixel\" is called \"nside\" (the relation between both is {math}`n_{\\mathrm{side}} = 2^{\\mathrm{order}}`).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major ways of numbering the \"pixels\" (the \"indexing scheme\"):\n",
    "- `\"ring\"`, which assigns IDs to pixels based on the latitude rings they are on, such that pixels on the same latitude will have IDs close to each other.\n",
    "- `\"nested\"`, which assigns IDs based on the pixel hierarchy, such that pixels within the same parent pixel have IDs close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Some Healpix libraries use the boolean `nest` to indicate the indexing scheme)"
